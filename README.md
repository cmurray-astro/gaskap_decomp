# GASKAP GaussPy+ Decomposition

Initial tests for decomposing GASKAP data with  [GaussPy+](https://github.com/mriener/gausspyplus). Workflow follows the examples in the GaussPy+ Tutorials, and modified code (e.g., for constructing CNM maps) is found in [my local fork](https://github.com/cmurray-astro/gausspyplus/blob/master/gausspyplus/decompose.py) (for now). Data is not included, but results should be reproducible by running these: 

* prepare_smc.py
* training_set_smc.py
* train_smc.py
* decompose_smc.py
* diagnostics_smc.py
